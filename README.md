### - What this repository is

    :This is My resume page where I can upload my development work as Project and my study as Posting. Project is the place where I explain my codes in Projects line by line using snippets and pictures (ckeditor) and Posting is the place where I post what I have learnt this week using snippets and picutres (ckeditor).
    
### - What I try to focus on this project

    : 1) Postings and Projects are written in both English and Korean to meet with more audiences and I have implemented the corresponding database design; Posten & Postko and they are linked One to One relationship to each other by matching "number" field. 
    
    : 2) People can leave their comments on the Projects and Postings as they signed in. To make it easy to sign in, I have made two ways in sign into the platform 1) registration via email verification 2) social account login using Github & Facebook account. 
    
    : 3) I focus on making this website user friendly. scrolling javascript event in the landing page is a one of features that I make for a user firendly UI / UX.
    
    : 4) They are three classification depends on the accessing privileges and users are given either one of two privileges (users and uploaders). I make other people (uploaders) to upload their projects and postings in case of collaborative works.
